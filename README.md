# MyReads Project

This is Readme App using React. The app manages a set of books by populating each of them in one of 3 shelves. The app has 2 pages; Main page that displays the 3 shelves and under each shelf you can find the assigned books. each book has a control that allows you to change the shelf it's assigned to.
The second page is for book search. Once you type search text the matching books will display in the search page. The book shelf is retained between pages and can be changed from the search page as well as from the main page. Any changes are reflected in all pages.
